# Analysis of ATAC-seq Data Using the ENCODE Pipeline

## 1. Objective  
The objective of this project was to preprocess and analyze ATAC-seq data for six samples using the ENCODE ATAC-seq pipeline. The samples analyzed were:  
- **CSC449N**, **CSC_522**, **POP_074**, **POP160**, and **POP_170**.  

This involved submitting `.json` configuration files to a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster using `.sh` job scripts, followed by analyzing the results generated by the pipeline.

## 2. Summary  
Using the ENCODE pipeline, I processed six ATAC-seq datasets to assess chromatin accessibility across the samples. This required generating appropriate configuration `.json` files, submitting these jobs to the HPC using SLURM `.sh` scripts, and managing computational resources effectively to ensure successful execution.

## 3. Workflow/Methodology  

### Step 1: Preparing Configuration Files (.json)  
Each sample required a `.json` configuration file specifying:  
- Input BAM files and peak files.  
- Metadata including sample names and experimental conditions.  
- ENCODE pipeline parameters (e.g., species, reference genome).  

Example snippet from a `.json` file:  
```json
{
  "atac.pipeline_type": "atac-seq",
  "atac.genome_tsv": "/path/to/genome.tsv",
  "atac.bam": ["/path/to/sample_CSC449N.bam"],
  "atac.paired_end": true
}
